# CCC
Doing some CCC practice, will post here.

I'm a complete amateur in programming and even more of an amateur in competitive programming. This is a learning experience, so follow along. I will update the README.md with any information that I found interesting.

Doing this on NetBeans IDE, so to send it to CCCGrader, I had to change the main method to Main and remove the package line.


CCC2018S1: Logic wasn't hard but what the hell was this printing problem I had? Shoutout to Felix and Vert, they told me that I needed to format the doubles to just .1 with:
System.out.printf("%.1f", neighbourhood[0]);

CCC2000S1J3: Apart from mixing up += and =+, there weren't problems with the simulation itself. The problem came with TLEing; case two and three simply took too long. It was my first encounter with problems like those, and it sucked.

CCC2017S1: I need to try some more than S1s, but S1s and S2s still take too much time for me to solve I think. The logic was simple, I just had to learn some things about input. BufferedReader reduces time, I need to use StringTokenizer to split numbers with spaces, and need to refresh after every line. Comments have been made on the source code for this.

CCC2002J2: Yeah this one is a J2. It's a simple strings one, but I suck at strings, so this helps. It's a good ease into learning about substrings, charAt, length, etc.

CCC2017S2: Yep, I made this too complicated. I'll look into it again. Logic isn't hard, just implementation with arrays. Will keep posting about it.

CCC2016S2: Easiest one there is.

CCC2012S1: HUGE wake-up call to relearn combinatorics. I had to get help from friends for this one since I just completely blanked out. n = jerseys - 1  and k = 3.

CCC2017J3: Nothing tough, just some basic implementation.

CCC2014S1: It's a pretty hard S1; at least, it made me THINK the most. I learned about arraylists! That was cool.

CCC2015S1: More arraylists. Easy. I'm getting stuck on a J3. I'm trying to use recursion. Will keep updating.

CCC2012S2: I should have used switches, but it doesn't really matter. Anyways, I tried using a couple methods, but this last one keeps the conditions fine. I was actually having trouble with it until I realized I had to put the first condition in the && to make sure it doesn't check the second one which goes out of index. You can see it in the last few lines.

CCC2011S1: Easy string question, and I suck at strings.
