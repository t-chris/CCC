# CCC
Doing some CCC practice, will post here.

I'm a complete amateur in programming and even more of an amateur in competitive programming. This is a learning experience, so follow along. I will update the README.md with any information that I found interesting.


CCC2018S1: Logic wasn't hard but what the hell was this printing problem I had? Shoutout to Felix and Vert, they told me that I needed to format the doubles to just .1 with:
System.out.printf("%.1f", neighbourhood[0]);
